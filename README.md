Logistic regression has many applications in data science, but in the world of healthcare, it can really drive life-changing action.In this project, we'll be able to detect breast cancer by applying a logistic regression model on a real-world dataset and predict whether a tumor is benign (not breast cancer) or malignant (breast cancer) based off its characteristics.

We are specifically using logistic regression model, to identify correlations between the following 9 independent variables and the class of the tumor (benign or malignant).

The following are the features used in the project to detect cancer:

* Clump thickness
* Uniformity of cell size
* Uniformity of cell shape
* Marginal adhesion
* Single epithelial cell
* Bare Nuclei
* Bland chromatin
* Normal nucleoli
* Mitoses

Logistic regression can identify important predictors of breast cancer using odds ratios and generate confidence intervals that provide additional information for decision-making. Model performance depends on the ability of the radiologists to accurately identify findings on mammograms.
